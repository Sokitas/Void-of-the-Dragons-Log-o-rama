## NOTICE

If you encounter any false positives from Windows Defender, claiming the file contains a Trojan, be aware that this is a common false positive associated with executables built with some versions of pyinstaller. 
It seems the way the application reads and writes the config file in its directory is seen as snooping around. I sent the 1.9 version to Microsoft for investigation and possible whitelisting.

## Tips

You can grab me a coffee at Ko-fi. It's completely optional, though. I'd honestly prefer you use your money where it matters most for you.
